### ML promises to transform robotics: teach robots through demonstrations instead of code.

The field is early. The ecosystem lacks dedicated tools to make development simple, repeatable, and accessible:

- **Data collection is expensive**: hardware integration, teleoperation setup, dataset curation all require specialized expertise
- **Data is messy**: multi-rate sensors, format fragmentation, re-recording for each framework
- **Deployment is complex**: vendor-specific APIs, hardware compatibility issues, monitoring infrastructure from scratch

Teams spend more time fighting infrastructure than building capabilities.

### **Positronic is an end-to-end toolkit for ML-driven robotics.**

It covers the full lifecycle: bring hardware online, capture and curate datasets, train and evaluate policies, deploy inference, and iterate.

**Connect any hardware to any AI model.** Store your data once, train on any framework. Deploy with a unified inference API. All in plain Python, no ROS required.

### **How Positronic differs from LeRobot**

LeRobot focuses on training: fast experiments on reference hardware and public datasets. Positronic adds the operational infrastructure: hardware drivers, data collection tools, unified inference API, and iteration workflows. We use LeRobot for training. Positronic adds the lifecycle management around it.
