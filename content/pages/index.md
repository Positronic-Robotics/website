### Machine learning in robotics is still mostly broken.

Collecting data is expensive, curation is messy, and wiring up sensors, robots, and inference is harder than it should be.

### **We’re fixing this by building two core pieces:**

- **⚡ Positronic Runtime** — immediate-mode, Python-native middleware to wire cameras, arms, sensors, and inference. Simple to read, extend, and ship.
- **📂 Data OS for Robotics** — a dataset format that handles multi-rate sensor data natively, plus a web UI to browse, label, filter, and curate episodes.

### **Who it’s for**

Teams building manipulation systems that need reliable data pipelines and quick bring-up on real hardware.

**Our repositories:**

- **[Positronic Runtime & Data OS](https://github.com/Positronic-Robotics/positronic)** — Python-native stack for real-life ML robotics.
- **[Configuronic](https://github.com/Positronic-Robotics/configuronic)** — a typed CLI for experiments and training scripts.

### **Open-source first**

Core components are being released progressively; commercial tooling will stay compatible.
