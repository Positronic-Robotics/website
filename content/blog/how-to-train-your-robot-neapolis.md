The focus was on how modern manipulation robots are actually trained today, why data matters, and why the field is moving from programming toward learning-based systems. This was an open lecture organized by the **BSc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence** at Neapolis, with full scholarships provided by the **JetBrains Foundation**.

This presentation is designed as a **basic introduction** to ML and robotics for bachelor's degree students. However, if you are not deeply familiar with the current state of Physical AI, it might give you a good overview of where the field is heading.

It was great meeting students and discuss the direction robotics is taking.
